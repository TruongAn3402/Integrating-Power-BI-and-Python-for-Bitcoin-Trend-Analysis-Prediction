summarizes the research process of the topic "Combining Power BI and Python in Bitcoin Analysis and Prediction", including building a theoretical basis for Bitcoin, collecting data from Binance and analyzing price fluctuations using Power BI. The team applied machine learning models such as linear regression and SVM to predict Bitcoin price trends, showing that the method provides high accuracy. However, the research still faces limitations due to market volatility and limitations of prediction models. Finally, the team expressed their thanks and hoped the research results would be useful to investors.
